# Maybe Marquee

## Information
This project showcases the Maybe Marquee Text functionality. Essentially, it takes text string and text style parameters and attempts to fit them within the available horizontal space. If the text fits without overflowing, all is well. However, if it exceeds the space, it initiates a marquee effect, scrolling the text horizontally from left to right.
